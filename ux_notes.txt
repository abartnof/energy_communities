highlight state and county
add clean investment monitor data
add filter to top for dataset
look for dashboards that mix granularities eg some data is state and some is census, see how this works

click on county- drill in to what's actually there
ability to roll up to county level on map-- because state is too broad to make an impact
we want to find places with lots of manufacturing, and existing energy infrastructure

number of factories isn't relevant-- it's size of investment in USD or number of jobs
consider this: https://utilitytransitionhub.rmi.org/ira-sites-map/ as an example of successful points on a map

we want TWO DOTS overlayed, in terms of 2 metrics each:
1. clean repowering map (color should be type of renewable that's most cost effective, and size is potential MwH?)
2. clean investment monitor (manufacturing type, eg battery/solar, and then size of investment

Friday we'll talk through the tool as it stands-- what it does, and why it does it. so think about that the next few days
verify that we can't have two dots that mean different things (pink large means one thing, blue large means another)? chat with google

add tables to the bottom, one for CIM, one for CR
manufacturing_energy_and_industry_facility_metadata:
manufacturing is what we're really interested in here (don't change anything as is just know that that's what we're interested in)
make the rollover more informative (eg Mw, county, state, company name, $ invested, etc-- go gonzo)

make the colors more informative wrt clean investment monitor-- not just 2 datasets
the normalized dots aren't informative-- they need to be really representative


bug: manufacturing: batteries isn't showing up
try to do this sooner than later so they have time to use the dashboard in advance of our mtg so we can speak with intention
i can ping jeremy via text through wednesday, teams from thursday on

Meeting with Jeremy, Uday, and Alex

wrt the virtuous cycle:
what needs to be true for an anchor to exist, and what sequencing needs to be there
each step in the virtuous cycle relies on a relationship, which is geographicly defined
energy communities should be included-- kind of overlaps with clean repowering

1. high quality resources
2. clean growth tool, iwg, etc

so for each relationship, we need KIND of each diad, and QUANTITY of each diad, and then DISTANCE 
these diads may also have a TIME LAG

this doesn't have to be defined as a triangle-- we can just define a set of metrics for any given area, and then find areas where there's a lot of high metrics

TODO:
metrics are defined as quantities that are essential/relevant for each step in the virtuous cycle

within a given region (economic development districts/zone), we want metrics:
	ability to zoom out to larger areas of aggregation too. county? state? adjacent MSAs?
gigawatts of clean capacity
dollars of investments
(in the future: datacenters? semiconductor manufacturing?)

export as table, map, whatever

define each step of the virtuous cycle as a relationship of supply chain features (TODO)
rank regions in terms of these combos of features
find absolute ranking

we'll define an area as competitive if it has a combo of a few metrics

the data shows potential of an area being fertile-- the story describes how this will snowball into success

aggregation levels:
EDD
County
State
